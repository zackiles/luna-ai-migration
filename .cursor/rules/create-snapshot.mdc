# ATTENTION[SYSTEM]: Create a Snapshot of the Codebase
The Cursor AI agent has detected the user is likely to want you to build a snapshot in this turn. Follow the steps below to determine if and how you should proceed.

- If the user **HAS** requested you build or update the codebase snapshot, run the script to do so now
- If the user has **NOT** requested you build or update the codebase snapshot, then do so AFTER you're done your current task
- Build a codebase snapshot with Repomix by running the script [build-snapshot.sh](mdc:.cursor/build-snapshot.sh)
