# How To Use The Repomix File
**CRITICAL**: Review the shown or mentioned file with the name `codebase-summary.xml` before actioning the user's query.

## Notes on `codebase-summary.xml`
- **REPOMIX FILE LOCATION**: Stored in `<project-root>/.ai/context/codebase-summary.xml`
- **REPOMIX FILE CONTENTS**: Contains ALL code, documentation, and tests related to this project summarized into a single file.
- The file was created using Repomix
- The repomix configuration is at [repomix.config.json](mdc:repomix.config.json)
- You can build a snapshot by passing the command `build-snapshot all` to the script [main.sh](mdc:main.sh)
- The file is manually generated and may be out of date.
- **IMPORTANT**: Use the file `codebase-summary.xml` ONLY as a reference, always inspect the actual files in the codebase for a completely accurate picture of what is actually true. The xml file may be stale and out of date
- **NOTE**: Consider regenerating the xml file using [build-context.sh](mdc:.ai/build-context.sh)

## After Adding To Files To This Codebase
If you've added code, documentation, or tests, you MUST include them in the Repomix config so that it gets included in the xml file

- Included files are added to the array of globs in [repomix.config.json](mdc:repomix.config.json) for the property named "include". Example:
```json
{
"include": ["README.md", "RELEASING.md", "add.sh", "encrypt.sh", "decrypt.sh", "install.sh", "remove.sh", "test/**/*.bats", "test/**/*.sh"]
}
```
- Never include binaries or large files or external or vendored dependencies. Only files for this local source code should be added using relative patchs to `<project-root>/` such as `README.md` or `test/README.md`
